#### What is a Matrix ID?<a id="1-4"/>

Your Matrix ID is your unique identifier in the Matrix network. It is a combination of your username and your homeserver. ([What is a homeserver?](#1-5))  
The format of a Matrix ID is simple: <code>@username:homeserver</code>. For example, if your username is "alice" and your homeserver is "homeserver.abc", then your Matrix ID is: <code>@alice:homeserver.abc</code>

#### What is a homeserver?<a id="1-5"/>

Matrix is a federated network of homeservers. What does this mean? There is no centralized "FluffyChat server" but there are multiple homeservers you can use. You are free to pick the homeserver you want. Like the email all users from all homeservers can communicate with eachother. There is a default homeserver on FluffyChat named "https://ubports.chat". You are able to host your own homeserver. [Click here for a guide how to start](https://matrix.org/docs/guides/installing-synapse).

#### What is an identity server?<a id="1-6"/>

Users in Matrix are identified internally via their Matrix ID. However, existing 3rd party ID (3PID) namespaces such as email addresses or phone numbers should be used publicly to identify Matrix users, at least for invitation purposes. A Matrix "Identity" describes both the user ID and any other existing IDs from third party namespaces linked to their account.  
Matrix users can link third-party IDs (3PIDs) to their user ID. Linking 3PIDs creates a mapping from a 3PID to a user ID. This mapping can then be used by Matrix users in order to discover the MXIDs of their contacts. In order to ensure that the mapping from 3PID to user ID is genuine, the intention is for a globally federated cluster of trusted "Identity Servers" (IS) be used to verify the 3PID and persist and replicate the mappings. Usage of an IS is not required in order for a client application to be part of the Matrix ecosystem. However, without one clients will not be able to look up user IDs using 3PIDs.

#### How can I enter a XMPP multi-user chat?<a id="4-2"/>

The easiest way currently is to use the bridge on matrix.org.  
Every XMPP multi-user chat has a Jabber identifier (JID) with the format: <code>chatname@chat.server.abc</code>
The chatname is the **local** part and the chat.server.abc is the **server** part. You can enter this chat by entering the Matrix public room: `#_xmpp_server_local:matrix.org` ([How can I join a public chat?](#2-2))  
For the given example this would be: `#_xmpp_chat.server.abc_chatname:matrix.org`

#### How can I enter an IRC node on Freenode?<a id="4-3"/>

If you want to enter the node `#chatname` on freenode you can just join the public chat: `#freenode_#chatname:matrix.org`  
Replace `#chatname` with the node you want to join and you are in.

## Error handling<a id="5"/>

#### Why don't I receive push notifications?<a id="5-1"/>

Do you have an Ubuntu One account in the system settings?  
When you go into fluffychat -> Settings -> Notifications: Is there a device "UbuntuPhone" with the label "This device"?  
Have you tried to logout and login?  
Do you have the latest version of FluffyChat installed from the OpenStore?  
Have you tried to turn airplaine mode on and off again? Sometimes notifications are sent with a delay from the UBports push service (will be fixed soon) If you still have the problem, then please contact me at the room: [#fluffychat:matrix.org](fluffychat://#fluffychat:matrix.org)

#### Why can't I connect with port 8448?<a id="5-2"/>

Sorry! On port 8448 the most homeservers use a different ssl certificate, which causes an error. Currently the xmlhttprequest in QML does not allow those certificates.

#### Why can't I connect with self signed certificate?<a id="5-3"/>

The same problem... I recommend you to use a letsencrypt certificate.
